# Beginner to Advanced AI Projects (Using Python)

This repository contains all my code, notes, and projects from the **“Beginner to Advanced with AI Projects (Using Python)”** series by *Saumya Singh*.

I am using this repo to:
- Practise Python foundations  
- Learn data science and machine learning libraries  
- Build complete AI projects end-to-end  
- Track my progress publicly  
- Maintain a clean portfolio of everything I learn
